## Abstract
We present a method for creating trajectory (temporal embedding) representations of songs and developing quantitative benchmarks for these representations on downstream MIR tasks. We explore related works in the field and explain how our system differs from previous implementations. We describe our music embeddings process and the web interface we developed to demonstrate our ability to perform music recommendation and genre classification using our novel representation. Finally, we present our results and discuss potential ethical concerns that come with developing a music embedding system.
